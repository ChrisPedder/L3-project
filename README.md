# L3-project

Repository to allow my TAPs to follow along with my Level III Tripoli rocket build.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository documents my Level 3 High Power Rocketry (HPR) certification attempt with the Tripoli Rocketry Association. It serves as a comprehensive build log and technical reference for my Technical Advisor Panel (TAPs) to review progress, provide feedback, and verify compliance with certification requirements.
