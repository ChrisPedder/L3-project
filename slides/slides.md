## Housekeeping

- This is a working document for the construction process.
- I will update regularly with developments as the build progresses.
- Details of e.g. 3d prints, electronics are in the repository here: https://github.com/ChrisPedder/L3-project .

## Fin Can Construction

This scale model has large, backswept fins, which protrude behind the motor mount. As such, our aim is to ensure that they are robust to ground strike.

To do this we:
- Construct the motor/fin assembly *outside* of the airframe.
- Use Proline 4500 structural epoxy for all fibreglass bonds.
- Prepare all bonding surfaces by following best practices (https://youtu.be/YA1ME6kN2gI?si=DmrqST1xLtOMQD2U):
  - Cleaning fabrication dust with water.
  - Sanding with 240 grit sandpaper.
  - Cleaning with acetone/lint free cloth wipe.
  - Removing acetone residue with isopropyl alcohol.
- Reinforce the fin-motor tube joint with fibreglass.

## Motor retainer location

- We are using an Aeropack 98mm motor retainer, with a 75mm adaptor for this project.
- In order to locate the retainer correctly within the boat tail, we need to create an appropriately-sized centering ring.
- We take measurements, and then cut out on the CNC.

## Motor retainer location 2

Once the CNC has finished, we are left with tabbed cutout, which need to be cut free of the matrix and sanded.

## Motor retainer location 3

After sanding and cleaning, the motor retainer is then mounted to the centering ring using the nuts and bolts provided. These are locked in place with a dab of cyanoacrylate glue (they will be glued over afterwards with proline 4500).

## Motor tube construction 1

The end of the 98mm fibreglass motor tube is sanded with 240 grit sandpaper, and then bond prepped with acetone and then isopropyl alcohol

## Motor tube construction 2

The tube is then marked for fin locations later, so that we can accurately align the fins when building the motor tube and fin module outside of the main body tube.

## Motor tube construction 3

The tube is then re-bond prepped, and prepared with proline 4500 epoxy.

## Motor tube construction 4

The boat tail centering ring, and the motor retainer centering ring are then glued in place using proline 4500, and allowed to set overnight.

## Boat tail attachment 1

The boat tail coupler needs to be slotted where the fins will pass through - the slots are marked using the fin slots in the body tube, and then cut out with a dremel.

## Boat tail attachment 2

The motor mount with the retainer and centering ring is then glued into the bond-prepped boat tail, and held in place using the coupler whilst the proline-4500 cures.

## Boat tail attachment 3

Once the epoxy has cured, the coupler is removed and bond-prepped, and the motor tube also prepped for bonding.

---

## Boat tail attachment 4

Proline 4500 is painted on the inside of the coupler, and on the motor tube, and the two parts are mated for bonding.

---

## Fin attachment 1

3d printed parts are used to hold the fins in place during the curing process, and to maintain alignment. The root edges of the fins are bonded to the motor tube and the boat tail using proline 4500. The fins are checked for alignment in the jig using a digital plumb line.
