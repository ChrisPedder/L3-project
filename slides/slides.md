## Housekeeping

- This is a working document for the construction process.
- I will update regularly with developments as the build progresses.
- Details of e.g. 3d prints, electronics are in the repository here: https://github.com/ChrisPedder/L3-project .

## Fin Can Construction

This scale model has large, backswept fins, which protrude behind the motor mount. As such, our aim is to ensure that they are robust to ground strike.

To do this we:
- Construct the motor/fin assembly *outside* of the airframe.
- Use Proline 4500 structural epoxy for all fibreglass bonds.
- Prepare all bonding surfaces by following best practices (https://youtu.be/YA1ME6kN2gI?si=DmrqST1xLtOMQD2U):
  - Cleaning fabrication dust with water.
  - Sanding with 240 grit sandpaper.
  - Cleaning with acetone/lint free cloth wipe.
  - Removing acetone residue with isopropyl alcohol.
- Reinforce the fin-motor tube joint with fibreglass.

## Motor retainer location

- We are using an Aeropack 98mm motor retainer, with a 75mm adaptor for this project.
- In order to locate the retainer correctly within the boat tail, we need to create an appropriately-sized centering ring.
- We take measurements, and then cut out on the CNC.

## Motor retainer location 2

Once the CNC has finished, we are left with tabbed cutout, which need to be cut free of the matrix and sanded.

## Motor retainer location 3

After sanding and cleaning, the motor retainer is then mounted to the centering ring using the nuts and bolts provided. These are locked in place with a dab of cyanoacrylate glue (they will be glued over afterwards with proline 4500).
